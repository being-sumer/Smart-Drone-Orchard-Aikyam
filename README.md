## 🌟 Project Overview  
This project was developed as part of the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024** under the problem statement *“Drone-Based Intelligent Apple Orchard Management in Himachal Pradesh”*.  

Our design proposed a **low-cost indigenous drone system** to assist apple farmers with:  
- 🌱 **Plant health monitoring** using multispectral imaging  
- 📈 **Yield prediction** through deep learning models  
- 💧 **Variable Rate Spraying (VRT)** for fertilizers and pesticides  

Key differentiator: Instead of expensive commercial multispectral cameras (~₹3L+), we proposed **DIY spectral band imaging** (NIR, Red, Red-Edge, Green), cutting costs by **70–80%** while maintaining functionality.  

📌 **Competition Achievement:**  
- 🏆 **Winners of PDEU university-level round**  
- 🌍 Advanced to the **Top 50 teams nationally**
